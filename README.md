Levees are an essential component of infrastructure for many communities in New York State, and understanding the flood risks associated with levee systems is crucial. Re-analysis and modeling of levee systems, and the associated flooding sources for which they were constructed, is required from time to time.  Changes in hydrology, hydraulics and the structural composition of levees may impact levee performance and impact the area, timing and extent of inundation. Emerging open source tools combined with improvements in USACE modeling packages facilitate this process, allowing for more rapid assessment techniques and advanced modeling options. This presentation will draw from levee analyses Dewberry has recently performed in New York State and elsewhere to discuss techniques for updating hydrology, adapting existing 1D models for 1D/2D analysis, and utilizing new visualization and mapping tools to understand and communicate risk.
